Here you can find the file with polygonal paths for clipping HTML's divs created using C# script in Grasshopper.
I wrote a Grasshopper definition which creates 3 x 6 voronoi cells and then translates them into CSS file in the form of clipping paths.
Also there are some work in JS to add color and scale effects to the clipped divs.
